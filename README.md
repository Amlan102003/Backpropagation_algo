The aim of this project was to build a Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network from scratch.
The implementation includes-: Initialize network,  Neuron activation and Forward propagation, Backpropagation of error and updating weights/biases
The model was tested on wheat seeds and the predictions were accurate(95%).
