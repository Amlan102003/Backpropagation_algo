The aim of this project was to build a Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network from scratch.
The implementation includes-: Initialize network,  Neuron activation and Forward propagation, Backpropagation of error and updating weights/biases
The model was tested on Wheat Seeds Dataset and the predictions were accurate(95%).
Wheat Seeds Dataset involves the prediction of species given measurement of seeds from different varieties of wheat.It has 3 classes of wheat seeds
